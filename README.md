# Basic-Portfolio-Analytics
Basic Portfolio Analytics is done on selected set of 3 Assets. Analyzing the selection of Assets in the Portfolio using Analytics and library of R specified for Financial Analytics.
The three assets that is 3 different stocks are considered for comparison to check for optimal tradeoff between Expected Returns and Risk for particular stock.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONCLUSION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Different individual perceive different values of Returns and risk; hence expected Returns and risk is calculated.
* But, this only not help to compare different assets and conclude which assets to consider for Portfolio.Hence, Coefficient of Variation is to be used.
* Coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure of relative variability indicating risk per unit return = Standard Deviation of Returns/Expected Rate of Returns
* With the help of CV, we can check for optimal tradeoff between Expected return and Risk and a better selecting criterion for choosing best assets for Portfolio.
  
  *The coefficient of variation for various stocks are as follows:

* Coefficient of variation of TCS:  3.523605
* Coefficient of variation of Infosys:  5.51816
* Coefficient of variation of Reliance:  6.578629 

LEAST THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION - BEST IS THAT ASSET TO INCLUDE IN PORTFOLIO: 3.523605 for TCS.
After calculating this we can choose TCS stock for investing as it will have higher returns with low volatility.
